### Project Objective
- The objective of this project is to analyze and mitigate hate speech in online platforms through a comprehensive approach that encompasses contextual analysis, temporal analysis, user profiling, geospatial analysis, false positive/negative analysis, and hate speech detection.
-  By addressing these aspects, the project aims to enhance our understanding of hate speech dynamics, identify patterns and trends over time, profile users prone to engaging in hate speech, analyze geographic distributions, evaluate model performance, and ultimately develop effective strategies to detect and mitigate hate speech online.
### Others
- **In this project I have done text extraction, cleaning, various analysis on the text data using NLTK and SPACY libraries and finally used pretrained model from hugging face to classify hate speech and obtained good results. Kindly take a look at the project explanation video.Thank you**
